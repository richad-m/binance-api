# Crypto-currency charts

**This page is a personal project**

This page uses Binance API to retrieve datas on cryptocurrencies (today's and past prices).
It also uses Chart.js to display prices over time (as of a month).

** To implement **

- Dark/light mode enabler
- Loader while retrieving datas
- Fix X axis
- Split JS in multiples files (one per function)
- Choose FIAT currency to display prices
- Change scale in time (retrieve data from 1d up to 6 months)
